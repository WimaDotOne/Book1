A Chinese Graduate Student

There were a lot of people at Pudong International Airport. A big portable screen placed in front of an entrance of a security screening area blocks the view inside. Fan, dragging a carry-on luggage, walked alongside the crowd. When he got near enough to the edge of the screen, he turned back and gave a smile full of sunshine and waved a quick goodbye to his parents. In his mind the screen was already the border between America and China that he was going to cross. Once he passed the screen, he would have passed the point of no return. He decided to walk in like a hero without tears. Fan took big steps, not looking back. His parents waved back and said goodbye again and again until Fan disappeared behind the big room divider that divides two different worlds.

Fan, 22, had never been to an airport before. He had never been aboard before. He had never been to America before. He did not try to tell apart these first experiences when they happened simultaneously. 

Fully expecting being surprised by new experiences, Fan's jaw dropped when he saw the big bustling space behind the screen. There seemed at least 20 lines of people waiting to pass security check, some putting luggages on belts, some standing in the middle of security scanners hands up, some unfastening their belts. There are people wearing security guard uniforms everywhere. This new sight of one aspect of society Fan had never saw before reinforced his sense that he was not in China anymore.

While Fan was being impressed, life suddenly happened and hit his head with a plastic chalkboard eraser.

"Sir, you cannot carry this onto a plane", a female staff took a box of mini screwdriver set out Fan's luggage and hold it in front of him. "You can either throw it away, or mail it back home for 20 yuan."

Fan looked back toward the screen he just passed and realized he was really on his own now. Fan calculated that the screwdrivers were worth more than 20 yuan so he agreed to mail them home.
