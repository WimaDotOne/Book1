A Chinese Graduate Student

There were a lot of people at Pudong International Airport. A big portable screen placed in front of the entrance of security screening area blocks the view inside. Fan, dragging a carry-on luggage, walked alongside a crowd. Right before walking past the screen, he turned back and gave a smile like sunshine and waved goodbye to his parents.

Fan had never been to an airport before. He had never been aboard before. He had never been to USA before. Fan could not tell apart these first experiences when they happen at the same time. The space behind the dividing screen was way bigger than Fan expected. The bustling scene gave him his first culutre shock. There are people putting luggages on belt. There are people standing in the middle of security scanners hands up. There are people unfasten their belts. There are people wearing security guard uniform everywhere. Taking all these in, Fan said to himself, "Wom I am in America now."
