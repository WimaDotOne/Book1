A Chinese Graduate Student

There were a lot of people at Pudong International Airport. A big portable screen placed in front of the entrance of security screening area blocks the view inside. Fan, dragging a carry-on luggage, walked alongside a crowd. Right before walking past the screen, he turned back and gave a smile like sunshine and waved goodbye to his parents.

Fan had never been to an airport before. He had never been aboard before. He had never been to USA before. Fan could not tell apart these first experiences when they happened simultaneously. 

The space behind the dividing screen was way bigger than Fan expected. The bustling scene shocked him. There seemed at least 20 lines of people, some putting luggages on belts, some standing in the middle of security scanners hands up, some unfastening their belts. There are people wearing security guard uniform everywhere. Taking all these in, Fan feels the portable screen he just walked around separated not a big space in an airport but two worlds. Fan was sure he was already somewhere part of America. Then reality hit him that he was still in China when a staff asked him to take out the box of mini screwdriver set packed in his luggage. The staff offered two options. Fan could either throw them away or mail them back home for 20 yuan. Facing first crisis, Fan's head was spinning. He spent half a second blaming his father for putting minidrivers in his carry-on luggage. He spent another half a second thinking that maybe his parents were still somewhere close on the other side of the protable screen and he should just run back and hand them the box. Then Fan randomly decided that he preferred to mail them home.
