Fan opened his eyes. The bedroom was dim because the curtain blocked the bright sunlight. He was aware that he was lying on a bed. He felt he was covered by a blanket. The blanket felt new, clean and fresh. The memory came back. Fan remembered he just arrived Madison last night and was sleeping in a rented house all by himself.

"What time is it?" Fan spoke to himeself in his head.

He sat up, reached his hand into his backpack and got out a clock. It took him a long second to comprehend. "What!? One o'clock in the afternoon! I slept for -- I went to bed at midnight and now it's one -- thirteen hours!" After acceptance of what happened happened, Fan reasoned that he had a long flight so he probably needed 10 hours of sleep. Then just when he was fully rested and ready to wake up, his biological clock kicked in and told the brain it was night in China and Fan should be drowsy.
