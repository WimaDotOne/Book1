At the age of 5 Fan began to form the concept of "America". China was where he was in. But not everyone lived in China. There were people living in places beyond China called "America". When Mrs. Zheng suspected that his son thought there were two and only two countries in the world, she took the opportunity to educate him.

"There are many countries in the world. China is a country. America is a country. America is a foreign country, but a foreign country does not have to be America."

The next day, Fan passed his newly acquired knowledge to his best friend, "Do you know there are many countries in the world? China is a country. America is a country. A foreign country is America, uh...uh," Fan was confused half way through the sentence, but he was determined to finish it, "America does not have to be a foreign country."

One day in Fan's second grade Chinese class, the teacher taught the alphabet table

The teacher would read a letter, and the students repeated the letter. Then the teacher would read a line, and the students repeated the line. The teacher didn't tell the students what she was teaching, but Fan figured it out himself that he was learning English. It could not be pinyin, because the alphabet table for pinyin was in completely different order.

Fan was excited. By the end of the class Fan could recite the whole table. It was the last period before students went home for lunch. When the bell rang, Fan was still immersed in the rhythm of the alphabet table. He rapped the alphabet table again and again half the way home until he came across a cluster of kids surrounding a cart, raising their money, shouting and waving to get the vendor's attention, trying to buy snacks. Fan felt a dime in his pocket and joined the kids.

In 5th grade, the school started teaching English. Fan realized the alphabet table he learned in second grade was not English alphabet table. They were the same alphabets in writing but are pronouced differently. He still didn't understand why the English-like alphabet table was taught at all. He couldn't remember ever using them later.

One spring afternoon of his 5th grade, Fan spotted a glittering one-yuan coin on the side of a road. He picked it up and started examining it. It was such a beautiful coin. The printing of the number one was delicate. It had patterns of flowers on it. Fan couldn't remember ever seeing a coin so big and has flowers on it. He bursted with joy when he realized that he had found a US-dollar. He shouted to his friends nearby, "I found a dollar! I found a dollar!" His friends challenged him with questions like why there was a Chinese character on the US-dollar. Fan could not think of a reason and agreed that was a mystery.

During the following summer vacation, Fan watched on TV the rerun of Growing Pains, an 80's American sitcom. He watched the rerun again the next summer, then again the next summer. He really enjoyed the show. However he was deeply annoyed by one flaw of the show when it happened. The eldest son in the family of Growing Pains was called Michael. From one episode on, out of the blue, Michael's voice would change to a totally different one. It was like he had become a whole new person. Fan understood that when Michael grew older his voice would change from a child's voice to an adult voice, but he didn't like the drastic change.

In defense of the American sitcom, Fan was not actually watching the original version of the Growing Pains. He was watching a Chinese dubbed version. There were actually two voice actors behind the character Michael, one for the younger Michael, one for the oldder Michael.
