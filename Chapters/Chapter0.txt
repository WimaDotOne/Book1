I am the guardian angel of Fan. I am his subconcious mind, intuition and impulses. I am the reason he obeys the rules of the sun, the moon, and the venus. I observe and author his life. 

The first time I met Fan was the first memory of myself as well.

The sun was positioned in the sign of Cancer. In the biggest hospital of a small town in China, I appeared as the guardian angel of a baby girl who was going to be born. I waited to be bonded with her. I waited and waited, but the bonding did not happen because she did not live. After a few hours of chaos I re-emerged for a baby boy who just got out of his mom's tummy in a room a few doors down the hall from the baby girl's room. This time the boy was not moving or crying either. The exhausted mother's face was blushing and sweaty. Her watering eyes are filled with expectations. The doctor and nurse were too busy to explain the situation to the mother. I waited, as an objective third party observer who had absolute no personal interest in the matter. A nurse picked up the boy's tiny feet, holding him upside down, and slapped his naked butt a few times. Suddenly the bonding happened. The boy and I became one. I could not tell if it was the baby boy or me who was crying. I was struck by a sensation of innocence and curiosity. I began adopting the baby's personality since that moment. Suddenly I was humane. Suddenly I knew nothing.

Later in the hospital, the parents named the baby boy Fan. Fan's name in Chinese means the sail of a boat. His parents wished their baby boy sailing smoothly in life.
