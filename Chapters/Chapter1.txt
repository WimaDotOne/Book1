I am the guardian angel of Fan. I'm an angel that is assigned to protect Fan. I see the world on earth through Fan's eyes. I accumulate my knowledge on earth as Fan grows up. I help him make good choices through subconcious, gut feelings and impulses. I make sure he follows the rules of zodiac. Not every guardian angel enforces these rules, but I do.

Who is Fan? Fan is the one person I am assigned to protect on earth. I will tell you all about him. But if you are wondering whether he is famous or someone you should have known. The answer is no. On earth, he's only special to a handful of people. In the universe, he's special to me. I remember the first day I met him. The sun was positioned at Cancer.

I was not originally assigned to Fan. I was assigned to a baby girl that was going to be born in a hospital. She did not make it. I was shocked and thrown into total panic. I never expected that I would fail before even I could start. After a few hours of chaos I was reassigned to a baby boy who just got out of his mom's tummy in a room a few doors down the hall from the baby girl's room. However the baby boy was not moving or crying after he was born. I knew something was wrong again, because I was supposed to be bond with him after his birth, but the bonding was not happening. It seemed the time suddenly slowed down. The exhausted mother's face was blushing and sweaty, her watering eyes searching for answers. The doctor gestured to the nurse in slow motion.  Watching all this, I shouted at them, "Do something! Please save him!" Nobody heard me. However, the nurse picked up the baby boy's tiny feet and hold the baby upside down and slapped his butt several times. Suddenly the baby boy cried. At that very moment the baby and I became one, and I became his guardian angel.

Later in the hospital, the parents named the baby boy Fan. So I gave myself the earth name Fan after him. That's very common for guardian angels. All the guardian angels of Fan's friends named themselve after their wards.

Fan grew up in China. So I know China pretty well. Fan took a lot of math classes in college, so I got a hang of math too. Fan went to America for graduate school. I get to see the USA. In this book, I want to tell you my adventure in America, I mean, Fan's adventure.

First let me tell you a little bit of what Fan already knew about America growing up in China. You know, to set up a baseline.

Fan formed the concept of America when he was around 5 years old. He knew that China was where he lived. He knew that there were people living in places beyond China called "America". However, Mrs. Zheng suspected his son believed there were only two countries in the world, so she told him,

"There are many countries in the world. China is a country. America is a country. America is a foreign country, but a foreign country does not have to be America."

The next day, Fan passed his newly acquired knowledge to his best friend, "Do you know there are many countries in the world? China is a country. America is a country. A foreign country is America, uh...uh," Fan was confused half way through the sentence, but determined to finish it, "America does not have to be a foreign country."

My point is that he kind of knew what America was when he was 5.

When Fan was around 8, he tasted an American chocolate, which was brought back by his friend's father from a trip to America. He only got to have a small bite of a piece of the chocolate, but he was so impressed  by the flavor that he remembered and was able to identify what he just had decades later. How could a chocolate tasted like mint? At the time his explanation was it was American. Now he believes it must have been York Peppermint Pattie.

When Fan was around 10, he demonstrated that he wanted to go study in Harvard University someday by spending all morning painting the word "Harvard" on the back of a calendar paper. The paper was as long as Fan's legs and wider than Fan's shoulders. He painted the word large enough to fill the space of the paper. He used a ballpen to color it blue, which took him at least two hours to finish. After showing his parents his Harvard ambition on a calendar paper, he was tired and hungry. He had lunch, a nap after lunch, and watched TV all afternoon. Fan didn't go to Harvard eventually.

He was probably still 10. On a sunny afternoon, Fan spotted a glittering one-yuan coin on the side of a road. He picked it up and started examining it. It was such a beautiful coin. The printing of the number one was delicate. It had patterns of flowers on it. Fan couldn't remember ever seeing a coin so big and with flowers on it. He bursted with joy when he realized that he had found a US-dollar. He shouted to his friends nearby, "I found a dollar! I found a dollar!" His friends challenged him with questions like why there was a Chinese character on the US-dollar. Fan could not think of a reason and agreed it was a mystery.

During the following summer vacation, Fan watched on TV the rerun of Growing Pains, an 80's American sitcom. He watched the rerun again the next summer, then again the next summer. He really enjoyed the show. So did I. I do not remember whether Fan knew people did not actually speak Chinese in the American shows, but I do remember it really annoyed him when the dubbing voice actor was suddenly changed when Micahel was too grown up to have a kid's voice.

Students in China commonly have 6 years of elementary school, 3 years of middle school, 3 years of high school. Before elementary school is kindergarten. Fan learned at least one English song when he was in kindergarten. It went like, 

Happy new year, happy new year
Happy new year to you all
We are dancing, we are singing
Happy new year to you all

Fan did not understand what he was singing, he did not know it was English. He just liked making weird sound. It was an opportunity for him to release some child energy.

Fan's friend dined at KFC once around their 4th grade. Fan asked him all about what it was like.

"There was a picece of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and a bread." The friend tried to remember.

Fan loved roast chicken, but he never had fried chicken before. Fan's imagination of mashed potatoes was from a cartoon based on a German fairytale "The Robber Hotzenplotz", in which an evil magician needs eating mashed patotoes in order to perform magic. So it all came down to the bread, when Fan wanted to judge the KFC meal his friend had.

"How big is the bread? This big?", Fan asked guesturing a circle.

"Smaller"

"This big?", Fan made the circle smaller.

"Smaller"

"This big?", Fan was already in disbelief.

"Yes, pretty much!"

Fan was disappointed at the size of the bread and thought he did not miss much not having KFC.

The other brand the kids talked about from time to time was MacDonald, but whenever Fan heard his friends saying "MacDonald", he wondered why it was not pronounced "Madonna". Fan had his first American fast food in his 6th grade. His parents finally took him to a MacDonald in downtown Nanjing. It was such a new experience. When the family sat down, Mrs Zheng saw everyone drink soda using a straw, so he asked Fan

"Fan, can you go get us some straws?"

"But I don't know how." Fan replied.

"Figure it out, ask people. Don't be afraid all the time. You need practice."

Fan observed that people taking straws out of a box with the word "Straw" on it, but he did not see exactly how. He tentatively pressed the only part that seemed movable on the box and a couple of straws fell out. It turned out to be quite easy.

The MacDonald experience let Fan discover ketchup. Soon he found out one can buy bottles of it in grocery store. He had a phase of putting ketchup on everything. He did not really like the taste, but he enjoyed the idea.

In 6th grade summer, Fan's friend asked Fan to see Space Jam together in a movie theatre downtown, just the two of them. But Fan had never taking a bus downtown without his parents before. He wanted to go but doubted his parents would allow him to go on his own. It was lunch time when Fan gathered his courage to ask his parents permission to go with his friend to see Space Jam. Fan was nervous and his right upper eyelid twitched uncontrollably. Fan wondered why his eyelid twiched so violently.

"Mom, Dad? Tian wants me to go to see Space Jam with him? Can I go?"

"Sure! Just the two of you?" Mrs Zheng said.

"Yes." 

"Do be careful when you cross the street. Make sure you look both sides before you cross. How much is the ticket?"

Fan could not believe it was that easy. Space Jam was the first movie Fan saw in a movie theater without an adult gardian. Emboldened by the experience, Fan and his friends went to see Deep Impact and Rush Hour the next summer at downtown movie theaters.

This mundane event had a long lasting side effect on Fan, which had nothing to do with the movie. Ever since, Fan believed good things would happen to him whenever his right upper eyelid twitched. This belief was strengthened a couple of years later during a math final exam. When Fan was stuck at the last problem in the test, his right upper eyelid twitched at that moment. Then he calmed down because he knew he would solve the problem for sure. In the end he did solve the problem. Only three students in his class solved it.

Fan's elementary school started teaching English in 5th grade. But it played a less important role in students' grade than other subjects. For example a full score in Math or Chinese was 100. The full score in English was only 20. Only when it got to middle school, English became as important as Mathematics and Chinese.

During the 7th grade, Fan's English teacher organized a cookout on the school soccer field. The mud field had almost no grass growing, so it was okay starting wood fire on the field. The kids brought their own wood, wok, spatula, raw meat, vegetables. During the cookout, a teacher from America visited and talked to the kids. When the teacher passed Fan's group, Fan smiled, but too shy to say anything. Later one of Fan's friend told him that he talked to the American teacher.

"What did you say to him?" Fan was jealous because he knew he got a better grade in English than his friend.

"I showed him a sandwich, and I said, 'Do you want it?', and he said, 'No thanks'"

"Do you want it? It was so simple. Why did not I think of it?" This left an impression on Fan, at least until the next time he had an opportunity to talk to a native English speaker.

During the cookout, Fan's English teacher took photos of the kids. Then she put the pictures in envelopes and gave them out during class as gifts. Fan's photos are enclosed in an Winnie-the-Pooh themed envelope. Fan never saw the cartoon, but he associated it with good feelings.

The American teacher who visited Fan's 7th grade soccer field cookout later offered English classes in Fan's middle school. Fan was one of the 7 students of the 7th grade who enrolled in the class. It was on Sunday afternoons and it cost 10 yuan for each class. In the first class, the American teacher passed out a paper with a list of American names for the students to pick. Fan picked the name Rob. Then the teacher showed the students the meaning of the word rob by covering his face with the colar of his jacket, and holding up a finger gun, saying "Give me your money". I remember I thought Americans were so dramatic. Meanwhile Fan regretted the choice of his English name. A girl who attended the same class later sent Fan a Christmas card addressing him as Rob. So Fan thought he was stuck with the English name at least in middle school.

In the summer of 7th grade, Fan and his friend attended a citywise English competition. Kids acted in a 5-minute play speaking English, and judges gave them a score. Fan wrote his own play. It was a scene of two brazil soccer fans, in statium, watching the 1998 world cup final match between France and Brazil. Then history happened. France won 3 to 0. As a result, Fan changed the script so that it was about two French soccer fans instead. When Fan prepared the props, painting France flags on white caps and on white stickers that would be put on faces, he realized it would be so much harder to do Brazil flags. He had blue and red pens, not yellow and green pens. Fan did not win any prize in the end. But all he remembered was that a Canadian judge gave him and his friend's performance a 98 out 100. All the other judges are Chinese and it was an English competition, so...

The last event of the English competition was a picnic at a park. The Canadian judge was surrounded by high schoolers or college students who could acutally hold a conversation with him. Fan hold a dessert waiting patiently outside the circle. When opportunity presented itself, Fan raised the dessert and asked the Candian judge,

"Do you want it?"

"No thanks!"

Fan was pleased. Later Fan asked him to sign his notebook, but the Canadian kept Fan's ballpen and used it to sign other people's notebooks. Fan saw that as an opportunity and waited patiently again, when he was not busy, Fan said to the Canadian,

"Excuse me, that is my ballpen!"

The Canadian and people surrounded him all laughed.

In the 8th grade, Fan participated in a performance of "Old MacDonald Had A Farm", in which students wear costumes of farm animals and sang the English song. Some boys complained that they were too old to do that. Fan felt the same way. However, June 1st that year they would have their last celebration of International Children's Day, so Fan thought they were still recognized as children by the international community.

Fan was pretty good in English in middle. Fan had certain authority among students when it came to English. During an English class, the teacher was absent and a class monitor was left to quiz students on volcabulary. When Fan was asked to stand up and spell the word "modern", he said "M-O-R-D-E-R-N". The monitor did not hear clearly due to the chaos of the class without a teacher. Instead of asking Fan to repeat, she assumed Fan got it right and moved on to the next student. Fan later attended a very selective high school, in which Fan's English suddenly became average among his peers.
