22 years later.

Around noon at the Pudong international airport. Fan and his parents sat in a nice restaurant waiting, chatting, and eating their spaghetti. Mr. Zheng was in a good mood. He was proud that his son was going to study in the USA, a dream he once wanted to pursuit but never did when he was in college. Mrs. Zheng was proud of his son too. She was comforted by the knowledge her colleagues would envy her for raising such a promising son. Fan was calm, trying to save energy for the long journey. Nervousness and jitters were at the bottom of his stomach, he remained calm to avoid stirring those feelings up.

"Son, your life has been a smooth sail. Too smooth for you to grow up! I hope when you are in America you will experience some setbacks. Do you know how to wash your own clothes? Are you going to wear smelly clothes all day in America? Ew, please don't do that." Mrs. Zheng talked like nobody was listening while she was focusing on gathering a forkfull of spaghetti but to no avail.

"Of course he knows how to wash his clothes. Did he not wash his clothes in college? You always focus on the trivial stuff. Our son will be a great mathematician some day. Who has time to wash clothes?" Mr. Zheng gave his son a mischievous look and transported a meatball using chopsticks to his mouth and gobbled it down.

"Can you not make so much noise when you eat?" Mrs. Zheng was slightly frustrated by the noodles that kept sliding and dancing off her fork. "Fan, you cannot eat like your father when you are in America. The Americans will look down on us and say the Chinese are badly brought up."

Fan, holding a fork in the left hand and chopsticks in the right hand, picked up some noodles and started sucking as loud as he could. Fan looked up to meet his mom's stare and smiled with noodles still suspended from his mouth.

"Son, you should use a fork instead of chopsticks when eating spaghetti." Mrs. Zheng put down her fork and picked up a pair of clean chopsticks and start enjoying her noodles without the slightest sign that she was joking.

"Keep using your fork then." Mr. Zheng laughed and picked up his wife's fork and handed it back to her.

"The chopsticks are more convenient after all." Mrs. Zheng realized the irony and tried to suppress a smile. She added, "I am not the one who is going to live in America. What time is the plane again?"

"Two thirty-five. We have plenty of time." Mr. Zheng replied.

"Yes, it was two thirty-five pm. But I need to board the plane an hour before the plane takes off. I should give myself an hour to pass the security check. We still have half an hour." Fan took out a half transparent green plastic file folder out of his beige backpack. Out of the file folder, he picked up three plane tickets and showed them to his mom. One ticket was from Shanghai to Chicago. One ticket was from Chicago to Madison. One ticket was the actual boarding pass for the plane from Shanghai to Chicago.

"Put them back, don't lose them." Mrs. Zheng instructed his son. 

Fan carefully put the tickets back into his file folder and put the file folder back in his beige backpack. Also inside the file folder, there were some brochures given during the purchase of the plane tickets, his passport, student visa document I-20, a receipt of payment of some fee to some US bureau, admisson letter from the mathematics department of University of Wisconsin - Madison, diploma of his bachelor's degree from USTC (University of Science and Technology of China), transcripts from USTC, TOFEL transcripts, GRE transcripts, three photos of him with his parents, an envelope of 200 RMB, a key to his parent's new home which was still under renovation, an envelope of almost 2000 US dollars. "Amost" because Fan scattered some cash in different pockets just in case he lost the envelope.

"I am full." Mrs. Zheng only had a few bites from her plate.

"Well, more for me then." Mr. Zheng dumped the noodles in his wife's plate on top of his.

"Why did you order me a spaghetti?" Mrs. Zheng took a bag of bread from her purse and started to pinch morsels and put them in her mouth.

"It was our son's idea. He wanted to order spaghetti, so I think we should all have spaghetti. You know to present a uniform front."

Duing the time Fan was pareparing the trip to America, he had had an idea that he should ease himself into eating American cusine. He had thought up the idea as a joke, but was whimsical enough to go with it. He had bought a jar of salad dressing and started cover all kinds of vegetables with it. He did not like it. Fan knew he was going to cook Chinese food in America. The luggages that Fan had checked in with the airline contained a wok, a pot, and two knives.

It was time for Fan to go to security check. Fan and his parents rarely hug, but they wondered whether they should do what people do on TV when saying goodbye at airport. It was their first airport goodbye scene.

"Should we hug?" Fan looked at his dad.

"Of course."

Son and father hugged and padded on each other's back. 

"I need a hug from my son too."

Son and mother, still grasping a bag of bread, hugged as well.

"Oh, give the bread to Fan. Just in case he got hungry." Mr. Zheng looked his wife and pointed at the bread.

"I don't need it."

"Just keept it" Mrs. Zheng already opened Fan's beige backpack and stuff the bag of bread in it.

Fan carried the backpack and dragged the carry-on luggage walked toward the entrance of security check. Before he reached the point of no return, Fan, smiling like sunshine, turned back and waved at his parents who were kept behind some stanchions.

"Goodbye!"

"Goodbye! Take care of yourself!"

Fan walked past the entrance not looking back anymore. He felt like a hero entering a world of unknown. The security check area was bustled with travellers waiting to pass through the security scanner doors, some taking off their belts, some taking off their shoes, some putting up both of their hands. Because this was Fan's first time to go to America, the first time to fly, he was impressed by what he saw. Fan hold the his Chinese passport in his hand, which he thought was an American passport, trying to find his way around the area, which he thought owned by America just like the US Embassy where he was interviewed for his visa.

"Okay. I am all on my own now." Fan said to himself.
