Li Xiaoyao has been badly injured from previous battle. He vomitted blood and collapsed on the ground. Zhao Ling'er wants to help him but she cannot. A gigantic water monster is hovering above the nearby lake. It towers over them. Zhao Ling'er changes into her half-human half-serpent form and flies through the teeth of the monster and dives into its body. Inside the monster, she finds and destroys its core magic source with all her power. The monster exploded into pieces and scattered into the lake. Zhao Ling'er is exhausted and badly injured as well. Losing her power of flying, she falls into the deep dark lake. Li Xiaoyao struggles to stand up, eyes searching the surface of the lake. Such a long time has passed, the lake returns to its original tranquil state like nothing has happened. When the realization that his wife has died hits him, Li Xiaoyao loses it. He shouts hysterically to the lake, to the sky. He blames himself for not being able to save the love of his life. He blames Zhao Ling'er for not keeping her promise of never leaving him. Just when all hope is gone, Li Xiaoyao heard someone calling him, "Xiaoyao... Xiaoyao". It's the voice of Zhao Ling'er but he could not see her anywhere. The next moment, Zhao Ling'er, in her human form, rises from the lake like a ghost or a fairy. Her image changes from surreal to real. She smiles and appears intact. She flies across the lake and lands in front of Li Xiaoyao with ease.

"Ling'er? Is that really you?" Li Xiaoyao cannot believe what he sees.

Zhao Ling'er touches his nose. It's her way of showing affection toward him. Li Xiaoyao is sure her wife is indeed alive and hugs her tight. He does not know how she is still alive, but all he can feel is gratitude for a second chance of life.

"Thank god, you are alive!"

"Silly, I have promised that I will never leave you. I am going to die." Zhao Ling'er's voice is feeble but jovial.

Li Xiaoyao and Zhao Ling'er, holding hands, strolls a scenic path.

"So this is the plan. We first rest a few days. Then I will take you to my hometown." Li Xiaoyao suggests.

"Sounds good, I am missing your aunt and your friend 'Little Tiger'" Zhao Ling'er is agreeable as always.

"I miss them too. But remember, we should never let them get close to our daughter. I am afraid they will be a bad influence to her." Li Xiaoyao says half-jokingly.

Zhao Ling'er giggles.

"Do you think our daugter will look more like you or me when she grows up?" Li Xiaoyao really enjoys being a father.

"You, of course" Zhao Ling'er looks at her husband with admiration.

"I hope she has your eyes and my nose. So it's best she half looks like you and half looks like me..." Li Xiaoyao lets go off the hand holding Zhao Ling'er and points to his own nose.

Li Xiaoyao is surprised to see that his hand is covered with blood. He has been so happy that he did not notice the state of Zhao Ling'er. Her arms are bleeding. Her back is bleeing. She has left a trail of blood and she is standing in a pool of blood.

"Ling'er, you..." Li Xiaoyao struggles to understand what is happening.

"Xiaoyao, I am okay. Let's go home."

"Ling'er, what's happening to you?"

"I am okay, Xiaoyao, really. Let's go home. Go home..." She barely can form a full sentence. She collapses into Li Xiaoyao's arms.

"Promise me, never leave me." Ling'er can hardly keeps her eyes open.

"Ling'er! Ling'er!" Li Xiaoyao wants to keep her awake.

"I am not... going to die. I will... never... leave you. I have... promised. I will... stay... by... your side forever. Xiaoyao... never had... parents by his... side. He always... pretends... that he... does not care. He actually... cares... more than... anyone. Xiaoyao... had a... difficult life. All of... his loved ones have died. Ling'er... does not... want him to suffer. I promised I... will... give you... happiness", Zhao Ling'er is vomitting and gulping her own blood. Every word out of her mouth is a bloody struggle.

Li Xiaoyao cannot bare seeing his wife in such a pain. He does not want Zhao Ling'er to be tortured by her own will to keep her promise.

"Just leave me. I will be fine." Li Xiaoyao says.

Zhao Ling'er shakes her head.

"Ling'er, listen to me. I am your husband, I am your Xiaoyao. Trust me. I will be fine in this world without you."

"I want... to... go home. I want... to... go to your... hometown. I am... the wife... of Xiaoyao... I am also from... the town of Yuhang. We are... hillbillies. Take me... home."

"Okay, okay. I will take you. I will take you to our hometown."

Li Xiaoyao carries Zhao Ling'er in his arms. Zhao Ling'er surrounds both her her arms around his neck. Their heads touches each other.

"Ling'er, if you feel tired, just close your eyes."

"No."

"Have a nap."

"I am afraid... I will not... wake up again."

"Silly, when we get home, I will wake you up." Li Xiaoyao repels another rush of sadness attacking his heart.

"Really?"

"When we get home, I will have my aunt, our daughter to wake you up together. Okay?"

"Do not lie to Ling'er"

"When has Xiaoyao ever lied to Ling'er? Have a nap."

Ling'er has a last look of Xiaoyao, feeling trust and safe. She closes her eyes. Her arms around his neck drop down.
