Li Xiaoyao has been badly injured from previous battle. He vomits some blood and collapses on the ground. Zhao Ling'er wants to help him but she cannot. A gigantic water monster is hovering above the nearby lake. It towers over them. Zhao Ling'er changes into her half-human half-serpent form and flies through the teeth of the monster and dives into its body. Inside the monster, she finds and destroys its core magic source with all her power. The monster exploded into pieces and scattered into the lake. Zhao Ling'er is exhausted and badly injured. Losing her power of flying, she falls into the deep dark lake. Li Xiaoyao struggles to stand up, eyes searching the surface of the lake. Such a long time has passed, the lake returns to its original tranquil state like nothing has happened. When the knowledge that his wife has died hits him, Li Xiaoyao loses it. He shouts hysterically to the lake, to the sky. He blames himself for not being able to save the love of his life. He blames Zhao Ling'er for not keeping her promise of never leaving him. 

Just when all hope is gone, Li Xiaoyao heard someone calling him, "Xiaoyao... Xiaoyao". It's the voice of Zhao Ling'er but he could not see her anywhere. The next moment, Zhao Ling'er, in her human form, rises from the lake like a ghost or a fairy. Her image changes from surreal to real. She smiles and appears intact. She glides across the lake and lands in front of Li Xiaoyao with ease.

"Ling'er? Is that really you?" Li Xiaoyao cannot believe what he sees.

Zhao Ling'er touches his nose. It has always been her way of showing her affection toward him. Li Xiaoyao is sure her wife is alive and hugs her tight. He does not know how she is still alive, but all he can think of is gratitude for a second chance of life.

"Thank god, you are alive!"

"Silly, I have promised that I will never leave you. I am not going to die." Zhao Ling'er's voice is feeble but jovial.

Li Xiaoyao and Zhao Ling'er, holding hands, strolls a scenic path.

"So this is the plan. We first rest a few days. Then I will take you to my hometown." Li Xiaoyao suggests.

"Sounds good, I miss your aunt and your friend 'Little Tiger'" Zhao Ling'er is agreeable as usual.

"I miss them too. But remember, we should never let them get close to our daughter. I am afraid they will be a bad influence to her." Li Xiaoyao does have a point.

Zhao Ling'er giggles.

"Do you think our daugter will look more like you or me when she grows up?" Li Xiaoyao really enjoys being a father.

"You, of course" Zhao Ling'er looks at her husband with admiration.

"I hope she has your eyes and my nose. So it's best she half looks like you and half looks like me..." Li Xiaoyao lets go off the hand that held Zhao Ling'er's and points to his own nose.

It takes him a while to register that the hand in front of his nose is covered with blood. He has been too happy to notice the declining state of Zhao Ling'er. Her arms are bleeding. Her back is bleeing. She has left a trail of blood and she is standing in a pool of blood.

"Ling'er, you..." Li Xiaoyao tries to understand what is happening.

"Xiaoyao, I am okay. Let's go home."

"Ling'er, what's happening to you?"

"I am okay, Xiaoyao, really. Let's go home. Go home..." She starts to have difficulty forming a full sentence. Then she collapses into Li Xiaoyao's arms.

"Promise me, never leave me." Ling'er can hardly keeps her eyes open.

"Ling'er! Ling'er!" Li Xiaoyao wants to keep her awake.

"I am not... going to die. I will... never... leave you. I have... promised. I will... stay... by... your side forever. Xiaoyao... never had... parents by his... side. He always... pretends... that he... does not care. He actually... cares... more than... anyone. Xiaoyao... had a... difficult life. All of... his loved ones have died. Ling'er... does not... want him... to be all alone. I promised I... will... give you... happiness", Zhao Ling'er is vomitting and gulping her own blood. Every word out of her mouth is a bloody struggle.

Li Xiaoyao cannot bare seeing his wife in such a pain. He does not want Zhao Ling'er to be tortured by her own will to keep her promise.

"Just leave me. I will be fine." Li Xiaoyao says.

Zhao Ling'er shakes her head.

"Ling'er, listen to me. I am your husband, I am your Xiaoyao. Trust me. I will be fine in this world without you."

"I want... to... go home. I want... to... go to your... hometown. I am... the wife... of Xiaoyao... I am also from... the town of Yuhang. We are... hillbillies. Take me... home."

"Okay. I will take you. I will take you to our hometown."

Li Xiaoyao carries Zhao Ling'er in his arms and walks slowly in no particular direction. Zhao Ling'er surrounds both her arms around his neck. Their heads touch each other.

"Ling'er, if you feel tired, just close your eyes."

"No."

"Have a nap."

"I am afraid... I will not... wake up again."

"Silly, when we get home, I will wake you up." Li Xiaoyao repels another rush of sadness attacking his heart.

"Really?"

"When we get home, my aunt, our daughter and I will wake you up together. Okay?"

"Do not lie to Ling'er"

"When has Xiaoyao ever lied to Ling'er? Have a nap."

Ling'er has a last look of Xiaoyao, feeling trust and safe. She closes her eyes. Her arms around his neck drop.

That was it. That was the ending of the TV series Chinese Paladin adapted from the original version of the role-playing video game The Legend of Sword and Fairy.

"Love is holding on, not letting go, stupid!" Fan stopped the video player on some movie streaming website. He had been binge-watching the show for a week. The ending made him upset. If he was Li Xiaoyao, he would never allow Zhao Ling'er to die. Fan had fallen in love with Zhao Ling'er, and he could not bare the thought that he lost her forever.

After a minute, Fan adjusted his thoughts from the fantacy world to the real one. He started to google the cast of the show. The actress who played the fairy maid Zhao Ling'er was Liu Yifei. She was going to school at the Beijing Film Academy.

After web surfing, Fan checked his university emails. One email really brought Fan back down to earth. It actually made him stressed. The email was from the University of Wisconsin mathematics department asking him to arrive for orientation on May 21st. Fan had thought he would have a whole summer to get emotionally ready before leaving for the United States. Now he only had two weeks. He had nothing prepared except having bought 30 GTM books. GTM stands for Graduate Texts in Mathematics.

Hi Diary,

Today all the graduates of math department wore white T-shirts with a big logo on the back that I designed. The logo consists the word "math" and the department number 03001. I made a V sign, the hand gesture, out of the letter "m" and the number "03", where "m" is drawn like the index and middle finger and "0" being the thumb, "3" being the ring finger and pinky. I know, I am a genius. It was a shame that they did not consult me when they print my logo on a t-shirt. It ended up not looking very good. I wish they have made the strokes bolder. And what's with the print of the name of our university? "USTC" looks like "VSTC" and no one even complained about it.

I did not go to the graduation ceremony today. My roomates told me it was pretty boring. I went to the university bookstore and bought ¥1000 worth of GTM books. It was really exciting. When I hold a math book and looking through the table of contents, my blood boils. It gaves me a hope that I will master the content inside someday. I wish I can read them all during the summer. Besides the same book that cost me ¥30 would probably cost $60 if I buy them in America.

I wore graduation gowns today. My roomates and I took photos across places on campus. Afterwards, we went to celebrate at a restaurant. I drank a beer and got a headache and my face turned all red. I learned that 700mL is how much beer I can drink at a time. I think I was a little drunk because I did a little dance-like walk for no reason on our way to the internet bar after dinner. I watched the show Chinese Paladin all evening at the internet bar. Zhao Ling'er is really beautiful. I think I am in love with her.

I don't know when I will see my college roomates again. None of my 3 roomates are going to study in the US. On the "farewell notebook", I don't know what it should be called, I wrote best wishes and promised them that I will see them after I finish graduate school. I know me, so I know I will keep the promise.

I probably will never see "watermelon-frost" again. Is she going to study in the US? I have so much adventure to look forward to in the near future that I don't miss her at all.

"Dad! Mom! Come over here!"

"What happened?", his father opened the door to Fan's room and switched on the light.

"I have to leave for America in May. Before May 21st. There's an orientation. I just received this email from the University of Wisconsin."

"Okay, what does the email say, translate it sentence by sentence."

Fan read the email out loud in Chinese for his father while double checking his understanding of the content. The immediate chanllege was how to buy a plane ticket. Fan knew his father had taken a plane before. He remembered that his father once left him and his mother a sealed envelope that contained a will and information of how to access a bank account in case of a plane crash. Fan never got to see the will because his father survived his round trip flights to Inner Mongolia.

"Okay, I will call the travel agency tomorrow." Fan's father pointed at a date on the calendar Fan already opened up on the computer screen, "Should I book a flight on May 14th?"

"I don't want to leave so early."

"How about May 18th?"

"I don't want to go to America before the summer ends"

"Do you have another option?"

Reluctantly Fan calculated the date. If he left China on May 18th, he would arrive at America still on May 18th because China was roughly 12 hours ahead of America. Taking into account that the actual flight plus layover would be longer than 12 hours, he would arrive at Madison at latest the morning of May 19th. Then he would have 2 days to recover from jet lags and settled down before attending the orientation.

"How about May 19th?" Fan wanted to have one more day at home.

"Only one day to settle down is too risky. You should leave plenty of rooms in travel plans" Fan's mother also joined the emergency meeting.

The whole family agreed on May 18th.

"Also I want to go to Beijing before leaving for America." Fan said.

"What? You don't have time to go to Beijing. You're going to America in two weeks. There's a lot preparation that needs to be done." Fan's father objected.

"Why do you want to go to Beijing?"

"No reason, I just want to visit a few places and come back." The place Fan wanted to visit was Beijing Film Academy. He thought he might run into Liu Yifei if he walked the campus.

"What's wrong with you? You are leaving for America in two weeks and now you want to go to Beijing? It takes at least a day to travel from Nanjing to Beijing. Our son is not sensible." Fan's father turns to his wife for support.

"What is this about? Did you meet a girl online?" Fan's mother sounds more understanding.

"I just want to go to Beijing for a day, what's the big deal?" Fan stormed out of the apartment. When he was in the stairwell, he heard his mother comforting his father,

"I understand our son. When I was young, sometimes I had a thought in my mind I just had to do it. Nobody can change my mind..."

Fan wandered on the street and went into an internet bar. He continued googling Liu Yifei. He could not really find a trustworthy source of information about her. But he was okay reading anything about her, even if they were garbage or lies, or information about someone with the same name. One piece of information caught his eyes. Someone said that Liu Yifei was going to study in Yale. Fan put two and two together and decided that Liu Yifei was not in Beijing, but in New Haven. Afterwards, Fan walked home and told his parents he did not want to go to Beijing anymore.

The next day Fan's father booked a plane ticket through a travel agency located in Shanghai. The ticket was from Shanghai to Madison, Wisconsin with 5.5 hours of layover at Chicago. The date of the flight was May 16th instead the agreed upon May 18th since that was the only available date within their time frame. According to the agency, Fan could board the plane with an ID without a plane ticket, but Fan's father decided to go to Shanghai to get the physical paper tickets that one can hold in their hands. Fan's father was just warming up to the ideas of buying things online or over the phone, but for something as important as his son's flight to America, he would not trust a travel agency whose office he had never visited. Fan went with his father to Shanghai. A few weeks ago they had a similar trip to Shanghai to have Fan's visa interview.

Hi Diary

I am going to have my visa interview tomorrow. I am worried that I could not understand the questions. I am worried that my visa might be rejected. Just remember you don't want to stay at America after finishing graduate school. I have all the documents ready. I have pictures with my parents showing my tie to my home country. I can only try my best, the rest is out of my hands.

There is a Nanjing Road in Shanghai and there is a Shanghai Road in Nanjing. You see foreigners everywhere in Shanghai. The Nanjing road is crowded with interesting shops with shining neon lights. Shanghai is such a fun place.

The US consulate turns out to be at 8th floor of a 32-story building where lower floors are basically shopping malls. My father and I lived in a hotel that was only a block away. It was such a cheap hotel that gave out a vibe of criminals' hideout. The restaurant on the first floor below the hotel was pretty good.

Hi Diary

I am so happy now. I passed the visa interview. I got to the building at 9:45am. But there were so many people waited there. I stood in line for an hour outside the building. After I got inside the building I stood in another line for half an hour watching people shopping. Then I said goodbye to my father and took the elevator to go to the 8th floor and stand in a new line for half an hour, where I saw a group suited foreigners heading out for lunch. They look so professional and optimistic. I assumed they were working for the US consulate and I had a lot of respect for them. Finally I went through security check and got into the waiting area for visa interviews. I waited another half hour and it was my turn.

The interview officer took the finger print of both of my thumbs and asked two questions. What school are going to? What major do you study. I answered and passed. I never got to open my file folder full of supporting documents.

After that my father and I went to tour Fudan University because I want to visit a rivary school. My abstract alegra teacher used to teach in Fudan. He said students when entering Fudan were as smart as the ones entering USTC but over the years they fell behind because they did not study as hard. I would not study as hard if I were in Shanghai either. It was such a fun place. USTC is at Heifei. There is nothing to do but study there.

I am so happy!
