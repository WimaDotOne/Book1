Li Xiaoyao has been badly injured from previous battle. He vomits some blood and collapses on the ground. Zhao Ling'er wants to help him but she cannot. A gigantic water monster is hovering above the nearby lake. It towers over them. Zhao Ling'er changes into her half-human half-serpent form and flies through the teeth of the monster and dives into its body. Inside the monster, she finds and destroys its core magic source with all her power. The monster exploded into pieces and scattered into the lake. Zhao Ling'er is exhausted and badly injured. Losing her power of flying, she falls into the deep dark lake. Li Xiaoyao struggles to stand up, eyes searching the surface of the lake. Such a long time has passed, the lake returns to its original tranquil state like nothing has happened. When the realization that his wife has died hits him, Li Xiaoyao loses it. He shouts hysterically to the lake, to the sky. He blames himself for not being able to save the love of his life. He blames Zhao Ling'er for not keeping her promise of never leaving him. 

Just when all hope is gone, Li Xiaoyao heard someone calling him, "Xiaoyao... Xiaoyao". It's the voice of Zhao Ling'er but he could not see her anywhere. The next moment, Zhao Ling'er, in her human form, rises from the lake like a ghost or a fairy. Her image changes from surreal to real. She smiles and appears intact. She flies across the lake and lands in front of Li Xiaoyao with ease.

"Ling'er? Is that really you?" Li Xiaoyao cannot believe what he sees.

Zhao Ling'er touches his nose. It has always been her way of showing her affection toward him. Li Xiaoyao is sure her wife is alive and hugs her tight. He does not know how she is still alive, but all he can feel is gratitude for a second chance of life.

"Thank god, you are alive!"

"Silly, I have promised that I will never leave you. I am not going to die." Zhao Ling'er's voice is feeble but jovial.

Li Xiaoyao and Zhao Ling'er, holding hands, strolls a scenic path.

"So this is the plan. We first rest a few days. Then I will take you to my hometown." Li Xiaoyao suggests.

"Sounds good, I miss your aunt and your friend 'Little Tiger'" Zhao Ling'er is agreeable as usual.

"I miss them too. But remember, we should never let them get close to our daughter. I am afraid they will be a bad influence to her." Li Xiaoyao says half-jokingly.

Zhao Ling'er giggles.

"Do you think our daugter will look more like you or me when she grows up?" Li Xiaoyao really enjoys being a father.

"You, of course" Zhao Ling'er looks at her husband with admiration.

"I hope she has your eyes and my nose. So it's best she half looks like you and half looks like me..." Li Xiaoyao lets go off the hand holding Zhao Ling'er's and points to his own nose.

He is surprised to see that the hand in front of his nose is covered with blood. He has been too happy to notice the state of Zhao Ling'er. Her arms are bleeding. Her back is bleeing. She has left a trail of blood and she is standing in a pool of blood.

"Ling'er, you..." Li Xiaoyao tries to understand what is happening.

"Xiaoyao, I am okay. Let's go home."

"Ling'er, what's happening to you?"

"I am okay, Xiaoyao, really. Let's go home. Go home..." She starts to have difficulty forming a full sentence. Then she collapses into Li Xiaoyao's arms.

"Promise me, never leave me." Ling'er can hardly keeps her eyes open.

"Ling'er! Ling'er!" Li Xiaoyao wants to keep her awake.

"I am not... going to die. I will... never... leave you. I have... promised. I will... stay... by... your side forever. Xiaoyao... never had... parents by his... side. He always... pretends... that he... does not care. He actually... cares... more than... anyone. Xiaoyao... had a... difficult life. All of... his loved ones have died. Ling'er... does not... want him... to be all alone. I promised I... will... give you... happiness", Zhao Ling'er is vomitting and gulping her own blood. Every word out of her mouth is a bloody struggle.

Li Xiaoyao cannot bare seeing his wife in such a pain. He does not want Zhao Ling'er to be tortured by her own will to keep her promise.

"Just leave me. I will be fine." Li Xiaoyao says.

Zhao Ling'er shakes her head.

"Ling'er, listen to me. I am your husband, I am your Xiaoyao. Trust me. I will be fine in this world without you."

"I want... to... go home. I want... to... go to your... hometown. I am... the wife... of Xiaoyao... I am also from... the town of Yuhang. We are... hillbillies. Take me... home."

"Okay. I will take you. I will take you to our hometown."

Li Xiaoyao carries Zhao Ling'er in his arms. Zhao Ling'er surrounds both her arms around his neck. Their heads touch each other.

"Ling'er, if you feel tired, just close your eyes."

"No."

"Have a nap."

"I am afraid... I will not... wake up again."

"Silly, when we get home, I will wake you up." Li Xiaoyao repels another rush of sadness attacking his heart.

"Really?"

"When we get home, my aunt, our daughter and I will wake you up together. Okay?"

"Do not lie to Ling'er"

"When has Xiaoyao ever lied to Ling'er? Have a nap."

Ling'er has a last look of Xiaoyao, feeling trust and safe. She closes her eyes. Her arms around his neck drop down.

That was it. That was the ending of the TV series Chinese Paladin adapted from the original version of the role-playing video game The Legend of Sword and Fairy.

Fan stopped the video player on some movie streaming website. He had been binge-watching the show for a week. The ending made him upset. If he was Li Xiaoyao, he would never allow Zhao Ling'er to die. Fan fell in love with Zhao Ling'er, and he could not bare the thought that he would lose her forever.

After a minute, Fan adjusted his thoughts from the fantacy world to the real world. He started to google the cast of the show. The actress who played the fairy maid Zhao Ling'er was Liu Yifei. She was going to school at the Beijing Film Academy.

After web surfing, Fan checked his university emails. One email really brought Fan back down to earth. It actually caused him a lot of anxiety. The email was from the University of Wisconsin mathematics department asking him to arrive for orientation on May 21st. Fan had thought he would have a whole summer to get emotionally ready before leaving for the United States. Now he only had two weeks. He had nothing prepared.

"Dad! Mom! Come over here!"

"What happened?", his father opened the door to Fan's room and switched on the light.

"I have to leave for America in May. Before May 21st. There's an orientation. I just received this email from the University of Wisconsin."

"Okay, what does the email say, translate it sentence by sentence."

Fan read the email out loud in Chinese for his father while double checking his understanding of the content.

"Okay, I will call the travel agency tomorrow." Fan's father pointed at a date on the calendar Fan already opened up on the computer screen, "Should I book a flight on May 14th?"

"I don't want to leave so early."

"How about May 18th?"

"I don't want to go to America before May 21st!"

"Do you have another option?"

Reluctantly Fan calculated the date. If he left China on May 16th, he would arrive at America still on May 16th because China was roughly 12 hours ahead of America. The actual flight would be longer than 12 hours. There would also be layovers. He would got to Madison at latest May 17th. Then he would have four full days to recover from jet lags and settled down before attending the orientation.

"How about May 19th?" Fan wanted to have one more day at home.

"Only one day to settle down is too risky. You should leave plenty of rooms in travel plans" Fan's mom stood by his father.

The whole family agreed on May 18th.
