Fan in America

One day when Fan was 5, his mom taught him that America is a foreign country, but a foreign country may not be America. During the same week, Fan passed his newly acquired knowledge to his best friend, "Do you know a foreign country is America, but America may not be a foreign country?"

One afternoon of his 4th grade summer, Fan spotted a glittering one-yuan coin on the side of a road. He picked it up and started examining it. It was such a delicate coin. The printing of the number one was beautiful. It had patterns of flowers on it. Fan couldn't remember ever seeing a coin with flowers on it. He bursted with joy when he realized that he had found a US-dollar. He shouted to his friends nearby, "I found a dollar! I found a dollar!" His friends challenged him why there was a Chinese character on the US-dollar. Fan could not think of a reason and agreed that was a mystery.

The same summer he watched on TV the rerun of Growing Pains, an 80's American sitcom. He watched the rerun again the next summer, then again the next summer. He really enjoyed the show. However he was deeply annoyed by one flaw of the show when it happened. The eldest son in the family of Growing Pains was called Michael, he was the star of the show. From one episode on, out of the blue, Michael's voice would suddenly change to a different voice totally unrecognizable. It was like he had become a whole new person at the beginning of a new season. Fan understood that when Michael grew older his voice would change from a child's voice to an adult voice, but he didn't expect such a dramatic change.

In defense of the American sitcom, Growing Pains, Fan was not actually watching the original version of the show. He was watching a Chinese dubbed version. There were actually two voice actors behind the character Michael, one for the younger Michael, one for the oldder Michael.
